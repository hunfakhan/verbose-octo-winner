    <p>A solar power plant generates electricity by harnessing energy from the sun through solar panels or photovoltaic (PV) systems, converting sunlight into electricity. In large-scale plants, sunlight is collected by arrays of solar panels that convert it into direct current (DC), which is then transformed into alternating current (AC) by an inverter, making it suitable for use in homes or the electrical grid. To ensure optimal performance and longevity, regular service and maintenance are essential. This includes cleaning the panels to remove dirt and debris, conducting electrical inspections to check for faults in wiring or inverters, and monitoring system performance to detect issues early. In addition, the inverters and batteries, which are crucial for energy conversion and storage, need periodic checks. Structural maintenance of mounting systems and cables is also necessary to maintain physical integrity. Through consistent maintenance, solar power plants can operate efficiently for decades, providing a reliable, cost-effective, and sustainable energy source.
